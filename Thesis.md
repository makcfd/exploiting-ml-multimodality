# Questions:
1. Stop search when contradicted found? 
2. Define success and if it reaches save the model and link to the registry 
    - success candidate: model has contradicted prediction
    - with which model to compare ? all trained with similar performance in metrics? 
    - if so, need to train and save many models and save their performance.  
3. Synch with the status and next steps
4. Authors use Mixed Intereg Program to calculate metrics. As solvers for MIP CPLEX IBM, CBC, Gurobi. Should we follow this?

# Thesis points

1. Add section Limitations. Should consist of limitations 
    that has been discovered or applied during the thesis time.
2. Optimiser also can have an impact on training process? (table 1 from link https://www.lightly.ai/post/which-optimizer-should-i-use-for-my-machine-learning-project)

3. Two types of impact to get almost similar models

| Experiment input |  Type            |   |   |   |
|------------------|------------------|---|---|---|
| Batch size       | Trainig process  |   |   |   |
| Random seed      | Trainig process  |   |   |   |
| Architecture     | Model            |   |   |   |
| Pram init        | Trainig process  |   |   |   |
| Optimiser        | Trainig process  |   |   |   |
| Lr               | Trainig process  |   |   |   |
