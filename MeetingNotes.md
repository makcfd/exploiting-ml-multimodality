1. Include random seed into experiments
1.1. During training save the eval predictions results for each epoch for each experiment. We will need at at the last stage 

2. Get all the models - forming pool of models
    - For each test observation apply each model
    - save the results. 
3. Once data is obtained anylise results to aswer next questions:
    - What is the share of instances that can be pushed to other side.

4. IMPORTATNT: Think how to present final results in tables and plots. 

For instance it can be table with 
- Model, 
- training characteristicst, 
- experiment round (i.e random seed, batch changes,) 
- and predictions shift
